ABOUT ME

My name is Adesanya omorinsola, I started my career in QA not too long ago and I love everything that involves software testing 
I moved to QA because I am passionate about people shipping and releasing product that are stress free to users.
I am currently looking for a jnr tester role to prove the skills I already acquired and to grow in the the testing field
